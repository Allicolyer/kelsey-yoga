        description: "My yoga journey started when I was looking for a gentler, more creative form of movement after several years of intense weightlifting. I received my 200 hours from Heatwise Yoga in 2020 and feel so grateful to be apart of the yoga community in New York. I view yoga as an active meditation and incorporate mobility, vinyasa and restorative (and some amateur comedy) in my classes. It’s important to me that my students feel like they belong in class no matter their shape, size, or ability. When I’m not teaching, you can find me in Prospect Park, reading, or with my cat children."
